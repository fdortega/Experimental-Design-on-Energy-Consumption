# Experimental Design on Energy Consumption
Year over year energy consumption comparison for the two largest cities in Texas, Houston and Dallas.

This project will simulate a new energy providers interest in projecting annual energy consumption for the two largest cities in Texas. The intent is to use the data to assist in generating future price plans.

The dataset used in this study was provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Data for energy consumption has been reported on an hourly covering the timespan of 2018 through April 2020.

The analysis will compare each individual cityâ€™s consumption in 2018 and 2019 to detect any significant energy consumption changes in either city.

Data manipulation, normality, and nonparametric tests were utilized to ultimately determine if any significant differences exist.
